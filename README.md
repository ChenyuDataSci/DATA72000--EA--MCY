# DATA72000--Environmental Analysis

This repository contains the code and data materials for my MSc Dissertation / ERP project.  

The aim of this study is to compare three modelling approaches for predicting long-term mean PM2.5 concentrations across the United Kingdom:  

•Random Forest (RF) – a non-linear ensemble method  

•Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) – a probabilistic deep learning approach  

•Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) – a local spatial-statistical model  


The work demonstrates both the strengths and limitations of applying advanced machine learning methods under sparse monitoring conditions, and provides recommendations for environmental monitoring policy.
